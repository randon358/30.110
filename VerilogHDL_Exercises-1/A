Question 1: 
a. 
module MEM;
  // Module internals would go here.
endmodule

module SC;
  // Module internals would go here.
endmodule

module Xbar;
  // Module internals would go here.
endmodule

b.
module IS;
  MEM mem1();
  SC sc1();
  Xbar xbar1();
  // No terminals, so no need to connect the instances to anything.
endmodule

c.
module Top;
  IS is1();
  // The stimulus for testing the IS block would go here.
endmodule

Question 2:
a. 
module FA;
  // Internals of the FA would go here, but are not defined per instructions.
endmodule

b.
module Ripple_Add;
  FA fa0;
  FA fa1;
  FA fa2;
  FA fa3;
  // Connections between FAs to form a ripple carry adder would go here, but are not defined per instructions.
endmodule
